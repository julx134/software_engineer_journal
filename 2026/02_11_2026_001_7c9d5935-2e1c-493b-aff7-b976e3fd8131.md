- Upon further research, the current implementation will not be able to handle a production environment.

- The implementation relied on using Python ctypes which can result in segfaults because we are using Python (dynamic memory) to call C (static memory) code directly.

- It is also not possible to “consume” a license without signifcant work and digging into the C implementation

- New Implementation: We now use the supplied Codemeter SDK which is a library that interfaces with the C code implementation

- Instead of defining ctypes and allocating memory, we just import the cmapi library from CodemeterSDK

- Redesign: Because we are using the SDK functions, it is much more robust, however, it comes at the cost being restricted to how the APIs work.

- We have to create a new license container as part of the docker compose which acts as our license server and interacts directly with the host and the dongles.

- The reason for this is because their APIs expect that the Codemeter runtime is running on one machine (either the host or one of the containers).

- If two or more machines run and share the hardware, there will be a race condition because the APIs handle sessions (i.e. who has the lock for the license).
