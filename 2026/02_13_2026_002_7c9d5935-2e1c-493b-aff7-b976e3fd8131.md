Finished the new redesign of the licensing feature. It includes:

Start-up guard – containers will not start without the dongle attached.

Runtime guard – containers will pause and eventually exit if the dongle is not present once the containers are started and running. There is also a retry mechanism such that if the dongle is found within a certain period, the program will resume as normal.

Simple build script – implemented a bash script and a docker-compose file that enables the licensing feature and process.

Dev and Prod environment license separation – There are no changes in the development environment. Licensing is only present when a specific build is executed. This means that developers do not have to have a usb license attached while developing.
